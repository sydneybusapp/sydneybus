Welcome to **SydneyBus**, your trusted online portal for exploring and navigating Australia's extensive bus and public transportation network.

## Who We Are

**SydneyBus** is a community-driven project committed to improving how people access and understand transportation routes across cities and regions in Australia. Our goal is to simplify the journey planning process and provide up-to-date information on bus lines, stops, schedules, and connections — all in one easy-to-use platform.

Whether you're a daily commuter, a student, a traveler, or just someone who loves maps and logistics, we’ve built this platform to make your transit experience smoother.

## What We Offer

- **Comprehensive Bus Routes:** Browse detailed maps and lists of bus lines in major cities like Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and more.
- **Timetable Access:** Check current schedules and service frequencies to help plan your trips efficiently.
- **Smart Navigation:** Search and view routes by suburbs, stations, or route numbers.
- **Mobile-Friendly Interface:** Optimized for quick access on the go via your smartphone or tablet.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to make Australian public transport information **transparent**, **accessible**, and **reliable** for everyone. We believe that clear route information empowers people to make better travel decisions and helps reduce dependency on private vehicles.


## Expanding Beyond Sydney

While the name started with a focus on Sydney, our platform is gradually expanding to include transport data from other major Australian cities and regional networks.

We’re committed to building a **nationwide transport route resource**.
